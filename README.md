[LIVE Version of Airpnp](https://www.airpnp.org)

## What it does

People who live in a big city know how difficult it can be to find bathrooms. You might go into a store and ask to use the bathroom and they all give you the same answer "we dont have a bathroom" or "you have to be a customer to use it". Now why would someone buy an item from that store when its completely uneeded. Well this is where airpnp comes in. Airpnp will show users where the nearest public bathroom is but also it will allow store owners to put a price on their bathroom and offer it to the public. Airpnp offers a booking system for users to reserver a bathroom in advances. Airpnp isnt only for spontanous use in the city but also just a simple way to book a spot to freshen up. Each listing will show the user what that bathroom consists of from showers to sinks. If the user just wants to simply take a shower after a long flight they can book a shower to freshen up.

## How it works

This application works by using Reactjs to provide the user with a responsive frontend which consists of user profiles, public/private bathroom listings and a mapping system. Users can rate private listening and even comment on how there experience was. This will then give the seller a rating so users know how well their bathrooms are.

## How we built it

**Frontend**

- The frontend was built with React using the reactstrap css libary. consists of user profiles, public/private bathroom listings and a mapping system.
